## Development

To develop and run this project you will need to have npm installed.

### Instal node.js and npm
Step 1: Download Node.js Installer
In a web browser, navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Click the Windows Installer button to download the latest default version. At the time this article was written, version 10.16.0-x64 was the latest version. The Node.js installer includes the NPM package manager.

Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
node -v
```
The system should display the Node.js version installed on your system. You can do the same for NPM:
```bash
npm -v
```
Open a command prompt (or PowerShell), and enter the following:

Just run and visit http://localhost:3333

```bash
pnpm dev
```
### Clone to local

https://github.com/FilipeDoria/xxxxxxx.git

```bash
cd "/local-folder-where-the-project-is"
pnpm i # If you don't have pnpm installed, run: npm install -g pnpm
```

### Run
It should not be necessary to run a specific command to serve the development version of the project as with the built-in plugins there should be a preview windows on the side of the code window however if not, or if you need to serve the project available on the network, you can serve it like this:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
or
```bash
npx vite --port 3333 --open --host 
#to serve it on the local network, available to be tested on multiple devices
```

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
pnpm build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.

### Deploy on Netlify

Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and select your clone, `OK` along the way, and your App will be live in a minute.

## Why

I have created several Vite apps recently. Setting the configs up is kinda the bottleneck for me to make the ideas simply come true within a very short time.

So I made this starter template for myself to create apps more easily, along with some good practices that I have learned from making those apps. It's strongly opinionated, but feel free to tweak it or even maintains your own forks. [(see community maintained variation forks)](#variations)
